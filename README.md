Matlab (www.mathworks.com) and Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) are required for most. Additional requirements are listed in the comments for each script and some of these are included in the Resources folder.

DTI_nets/:	        Scripts for preprocessing and preparing DTI data for connectome analyses 

minD.m:             Threshold matrices to minimum connection density (data driven)

iSWI.m:             Compute smallworldness index from individual level connectivity matrices

INC.m:              Extract individual network contribution from group level connectivity matrices

TargetedAttack.m    Conduct targeted attack on nodes

rEdge.m             Conduct a random attack analysis on edges

rfClass.R           R statistical package script for conducting random forest classification with connectome (or other) data
